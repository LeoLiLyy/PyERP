# PyERP

***Introduction***

PyERP is a Python-powered ERP system with Ntfy integration, osTickit integration, and Vikunja integration planned.
The project is so tiring that it cannot be finished quickly but soon.
You will not be charged for using this project and can use it commercially (why would anybody do that though?).
For more license information, please refer to the GNU license.

***READ BEFORE DEPLOYMENT!!!***

Thank you for choosing PyERP! As the only individual in charge of this massive project, I give you my best wishes!

DO NOT use Flask or Python to start the program

Use Docker to start it.

This project is active, so you can just use "./update" to update the system

Docker Desktop is recommended for docker, it has a GUI, so it's simple to boot

Please PULL when doing a modification on the code, then submit a merge request when committing the code

DO NOT edit the code on GitHub
